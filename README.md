# Loops
## AIM: This repository contains examples of different types of loops in C++. 
## Theory: 
Loops in programming are constructs that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. They are used to automate repetitive tasks and handle iterative processes efficiently. 
Loops in C++ are :
#### 1. for loop(): It executes a block of code a specific number of times. It is generally used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. The loop runs as long as the condition is true, executing the code block in each iteration.
   ##### syntax:
   1. Basic for loop: for (initialization; condition; increment)
   2. Range-Based Syntax: for (auto element : container)
#### 2. while loop(): Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The condition is checked before the loop body is executed.
  ##### syntax:
  while (condition) {
    // Code to execute }
#### 3. do while() loop: Similar to the while loop, but the condition is checked after the loop body has been executed, ensuring the loop runs at least once.
 ##### syntax:
  do {
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
#### 4. Nested loops: Nested loops in C++ are loops within other loops, allowing you to perform more complex iterations. Each loop's code block can contain another loop, creating a multi-dimensional iteration pattern. for() within for(), while() within while() and even for() within while() can be used for the purpose.
